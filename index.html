            <h2>What is she up to these days?</h2>
            <p>Sam is currently on furlough and trying to be productive with this unexpected period of time at home. 
                So far she's tried:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Making a macrame plant hanger</li>
                    <li>Vinyl wrapping her kitchen cupboard doors</li>
                    <li>Planting lettuces</li>
                    <li>Making homemade yogurt</li>
                    <li>And last but not least, signing up for a coding bootcamp with Manchester Codes.</li>
                </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="background">
            <h2>What's her background?</h2>
            <p>Sam was born in Cambridge but has spent most of her adult life in Edinburgh, where she now works as a retail manager
                at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. She studied History of Art at Edinburgh Uni, then after spending a couple of
                years working in the museum and heritage sector decided to take a part time distance learning postgrad in Events Management. 
            </p>
            <p>More recently Sam decided she wanted a new adventure. Her partner is a scientist and is likely to move abroad 
                for work in the future, and she wants to be able to move with him when he does. So, earlier this year, she retrained 
                as ESL teacher to open opportunities to teach English abroad and/or online when the time came.
            </p>
            <p>But, still something was missing. Sam is a highly ambitious individual and knew that she wouldn't be satisfied forever 
                in a minimum wage online teaching job. She knew she had skills to offer an employer - she's always been a high-achiever 
                with her academic work, gone above and beyond to fulfill her duties at work - yet she found herself stuck in a demoralising 
                and demotivating environment at work with no opportunities to progress. Then Covid-19 arrived.
            </p>
            <p>And so began her new coding adventure.</p>

        <h2>Up close and personal, <time datetime="2020-06-17">Weds 17th June</time></h2>
        <p>This week we spoke to Sam to see how she's getting on in lockdown. 
            We asked for her thoughts on how life would change, for better or worse, in the post-Covid 19 world. 
            This is what she had to say:
        </p>
        <blockquote>I think lockdown has given lots of people time to reflect and think about what they want from life. 
            Certainly for myself, I've been able to enrol on a potentially career-changing course.
            I hope the sudden enthusiasm for cycling continues too. Really, it's been wonderful having less traffic 
            on the road and I think it was the kick-up-the-backside that our politicians needed to invest in proper 
            cycling infrastructure. It's the way forward.
            <br>
            I do worry about the future though. Working in the tourism sector there is a lot of uncertainty about what 
            our industry might look like in the future. I'm lucky to work for a company that looks after its employees but I 
            think many people will be left unemployed at the end of all this. That's why I want to take this coding course, 
            to future-proof my skills and give me better career prospects for the long-term.
            <br>
            Anyway, for now we just have to take each day as it comes and see what happens. 
            And in the meantime I'll keep looking after my urban jungle!
